# HamsterCMS TUI themes
My pseudo TUI themes for [HamsterCMS](http://old.net.eu.org/). They are adapted for modern smartphones and IE6. Also, they are pre-optimized for ASCII art (not ANSI or Unicode!).  

## List of themes 
### `tui-bash` 
- Dynamic title depending on the viewed page. 
- Imitation of a bash prompt. 
### `tui` 
- More minimalist.
- Includes a script for automatic translation into 8 languages.
